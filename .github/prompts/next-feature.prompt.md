Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- plans/prd.json
- plans/progress.txt

1. Find the highest-priority feature, with functional or ui features being more important, to work on and work only on that feature.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Ensure that there are appropriate tests and that the tests pass.
3. Update the PRD (plans/prd.json) with the work that was done.
4. Append your progress to plans/progress.txt.
   Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase.
5. Make a git commit of that feature.
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.
If, while implementing the feature, you notice the feature is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
