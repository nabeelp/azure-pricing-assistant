# Progress log
## 2026-01-09 - Health Endpoint Tests Added

**Feature**: Add tests for web API endpoint /health

**What was done**:
- Added 3 comprehensive tests for the /health endpoint in tests/test_web_handlers.py:
  1. test_health_returns_200 - Validates HTTP 200 OK response
  2. test_health_returns_healthy_status - Validates JSON response contains {"status": "healthy"}
  3. test_health_responds_quickly - Ensures response time < 100ms
- All tests pass (26 total in test_web_handlers.py, including 3 new health tests)
- Tests use Flask test client for isolated endpoint testing
- Updated PRD: Marked health endpoint tests task as passing

**What was discovered**:
- BOM merge logic tests (_merge_bom_items) already exist in test_incremental_bom.py and pass (5 tests)
- BOM trigger condition tests (should_trigger_bom_update) already exist in test_incremental_bom.py and pass (6 tests)
- Both features were already complete - marked them as passing in PRD

**Next developer notes**:
- Health endpoint is simple but critical for monitoring/deployment readiness checks
- Consider adding health checks that validate Azure AI client connectivity (if needed for production readiness)
- test_web_handlers.py now has comprehensive coverage of all major endpoints except SSE streaming
